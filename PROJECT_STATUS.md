## Technical Debt & Issues

### 1. **Missing Dependencies**
- **recharts** - Not installed (added to component files but package needs npm install)
  - Used for advanced data visualizations
  - Alternative: Current implementations use CSS-based charts

### 2. **Environment Setup**
- Node.js/npm not available in PATH
- PHP not available in PATH  
- Project previously set up (node_modules exists) but runtime unavailable
- **Action Required**: User needs to ensure Node.js and PHP are in PATH to run the development server

### 3. **Code Quality**
- Mock data scattered across pages (should be centralized)
- Some inconsistent patterns between older and newer pages
- Type definitions could be more comprehensive
- Need more comprehensive error handling

## Conclusion

The ADESUA project has a solid foundation with 70-90% of the frontend implementation complete. The architecture is well-structured with:
- ‚úÖ Clean separation of concerns
- ‚úÖ Reusable component library
- ‚úÖ Type-safe TypeScript implementation
- ‚úÖ Modern React patterns with Inertia.js
- ‚úÖ Responsive, accessible UI components

**Primary gaps**:
- Backend API implementations (wallet, transactions, reporting)
- Database seeders for realistic testing
- Integration with external services (Ghana Card, Mobile Money)
- 11 stub pages requiring full implementation

**Estimated time to MVP**: 5-7 working days with focused development

The project is well-positioned for completion and demonstrates professional-grade architecture suitable for a production education management system.
