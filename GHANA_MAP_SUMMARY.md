- ✅ Consistent design with existing UI

### 3. **Documentation**: Complete usage guide
**Location**: `GHANA_REGIONAL_MAP.md`

Comprehensive documentation including:

## 📊 Data Displayed on the Map

For each of Ghana's 16 regions, the map shows:

1. **Schools Count** - Number displayed on each region
2. **Teachers Count** - Shown in detail panel when region is selected
3. **Students Count** - Shown in detail panel when region is selected
4. **Calculated Metrics**:
   - Students per School
   - Teachers per School
   - Student-Teacher Ratio (PTR)

### Schools by Region
```sql
SELECT region, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM schools 
GROUP BY region
```

### Teachers by Region
```sql
SELECT schools.region, COUNT(*) as count
FROM teachers
JOIN schools ON teachers.school_id = schools.id
GROUP BY schools.region
```

### Students by Region
```sql
SELECT schools.region, COUNT(*) as count
FROM students
JOIN schools ON students.school_id = schools.id
GROUP BY schools.region
```

## 🎨 Customization Options

You can easily customize:

### Colors
Change the color scheme in `getRegionColor()` function:
```typescript
// Current: Blue gradient
const r = Math.floor(59 + (255 - 59) * (1 - intensity));
const g = Math.floor(130 + (255 - 130) * (1 - intensity));
const b = Math.floor(246 + (255 - 246) * (1 - intensity));

// Example: Green gradient
const r = Math.floor(34 + (255 - 34) * (1 - intensity));
const g = Math.floor(197 + (255 - 197) * (1 - intensity));
const b = Math.floor(94 + (255 - 94) * (1 - intensity));
```

### Region Boundaries
Adjust SVG paths in `GHANA_REGIONS` object for more accurate boundaries.

### Metrics Displayed
Add more calculated metrics in the detail panel (e.g., performance scores, attendance rates).
